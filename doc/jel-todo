---

- get rid of a-assets, see how mozilla does it
- name generator
- remove hubs cloud stuff from webpack
- search for TODO SHARED
- powered by link
- bring in avatar audio system
- ambient sound meta tag
- skybox in meta tag
- drop config system (maybe keep some meta tags)
- drop envs in webpack config
- sessionId -> clientId
- refactor all event names to be dash-cased
- bring over muted ring
- index.html add networking config
- authorize + sanitize in NAF adapter
- cut down dead code
- review all deps
- consolidate channel classes
- make voxmoji float
- browser compat, show message if trying to edit file:// in non-chrome
- allow networking settings to be changed via qs
- remove all unused translations
- deal with filtering networking based on roles + hub setting for allowing edits
- build mode still showing presence list
- add service to register spaces
- cull permissions (in atom manager)
- spawn around origin
- make sure dropping same file from assets folder works
- need to figure out stack axis. it is stored in the DOM, but also can be in the file.
  - suggestion: take it out of metadata, and during writeback look it up on the media loaders
                when spawning, initialize the media loader with what's in the file

should push terrain chunks to origin on first edit
need to writeback page change on pdf iff its locked
video playback stopping when tabbing away
video play button missing
messing around with cursor, video, and console can cause 3d cursor to disappear (but highlight remain, so show 3d cursor prob false)
video tick should keep running when tabbed away
video reset to beginning when anotehr person joins (delay video ownership until joins?)
make sure removing CORS anywhere tag disalbed youtube
test HLS and dash
