- need to test flow when creating voxel without git permission
- deno cors proxying split + ytdl enable + move configs into index.html
- test ff + safari
- index.html add networking config (TURN, CORSAnywhere)
- take a stab at mobile view
- upload progress
- UX updates
  - left click to drag objects
  - left click on empty space to rotate camera
  - right click to shoot, or use brush
  - left click to add voxels in build mode?
- add a ui toggle button in top left due to docks on side of screen
  - this can be back button out of editor too
- duck should upload glb
- disable live HTML update option (search for allowUnsavedObjects)
- save HTML to back to origin option
- vox
  - editor UX
    - close button in vox editor, drop left panel
    - undo/redo buttons
- make cursor more visible
- if space is held first, then object grabbed, enable snap
- video play button missing
- make sure removing CORS anywhere tag disalbed youtube
- show cursor when create menu is opened via hotkey (any others?) - for ff/safari locking
- avoid blank commits

firefox bugs:
- need to test git uploading etc

safari bugs:
- need to test git sync of DOM once other things are fixed
- need to ignore spaces in diffs, or get spaces to be ignored
- toolbar elements etc are not clickable in quill

---
- chat messages are piling up
- drop non-used environment colors
- hide other instances in voxel editor
- Reset (G) is not going onto undo stack?
- tippy root getting into dom
- disable autocorrect on repo field in git dialog
- avoid adding viseme to outgoing streams that can't decode it
- preview color wheel on swatch pages
- make labels + banners start with a larger scale
- disable LOD on flat + plains
- pasting text not working, and causing cursor to act funny (not hoverable)
- smooth voxel mesher is randomized
- lock is re-generating smooth mesh, not strictly necessary
- get rid of a-assets, see how mozilla does it
- clicking in nav when there are unsaved changes causes dialog to pop up and view to go indigo
- remove hubs cloud stuff from webpack
- search for TODO SHARED
- powered by link
- bring in avatar audio system
- skybox in meta tag
- drop config system (maybe keep some meta tags)
- drop envs in webpack config
- sessionId -> clientId
- refactor all event names to be dash-cased
- bring over muted ring
- authorize + sanitize in NAF adapter
- cut down dead code
- review all deps
- consolidate channel classes
- make voxmoji float
- browser compat, show message if trying to edit file:// in non-chrome
- allow networking settings to be changed via qs
- remove all unused translations
- deal with filtering networking based on roles + hub setting for allowing edits
- add service to register spaces
- cull permissions (in atom manager)
- spawn around origin
- don't show unload nag if writeback isn't enabled
- disable other users from editing
- need to figure out stack axis. it is stored in the DOM, but also can be in the file.
  - suggestion: take it out of metadata, and during writeback look it up on the media loaders
                when spawning, initialize the media loader with what's in the file
- vox
  - close out TODOs
  - add shape, deform, other settings?
  - publish vox, should burn the axis, snap settings, scale
  - .svox linked (immutable)
    - cannot edit name
    - instantiated with scale, axis settings
    - can bake into new asset if writeback enabled
  - editor UX
    - show origin with ray
  - smooth voxel materials on left, text editor in middle
    - color swatches on left, sorted by hue
    - mouse over each swatch shows the voxels
    - group numbers, hover over each to see group
    - modelwriter custom fields
    - test compression base64
    - move meshing to worker?

should push terrain chunks to origin on first edit
need to writeback page change on pdf iff its locked
video playback stopping when tabbing away
messing around with cursor, video, and console can cause 3d cursor to disappear (but highlight remain, so show 3d cursor prob false)
video tick should keep running when tabbed away
video reset to beginning when anotehr person joins (delay video ownership until joins?)
gest HLS and dash
